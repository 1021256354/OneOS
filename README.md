OneOS (ComputerCraft Operating System) - The all in one operating system

Please note the OneOS has not been formally released yet and is only for private invite-only testing and personal records. Unless of course you somehow stumbled upon this, in which case you're invited :P

It's finally here! After many months of work OneOS is ready for it's first Private beta.

Please note:

I'm yet to get permission for programs yet, I don't want to get permission then deiced to remove it.
The App Store and Turtle programs have been removed from this release, they're just not ready yet.
Do NOT distribute this beta to anyone or inform them of it. While it is a public repo, it is a private beta.
If you have any suggestions for programs to add, let me know.
Obviously, any bugs you find create issues for. However, if it is an entire system crash (not just a program) it will automatically create the issue, just add a comment explaining what caused it.
