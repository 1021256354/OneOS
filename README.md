OneOS (ComputerCraft Operating System) - The all in one operating system

Please note the OneOS has not been formally released yet and is only for private invite-only testing and personal records. Unless of course you somehow stumbled upon this, in which case I can't really do anything to stop you.

It will almost certainly crash a lot, but if it does please post an Issue if it does not already exist.

Please note that I am yet to get permission to use some of the programs bundled with OneOS and will not seek it until I am ready for a public release as there is a good chance a few programs will change.
